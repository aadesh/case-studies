### Overview:
A leading healthcare solutions provider wanted to diversify their existing healthcare offering by addressing Direct to Consumer market in addition to their current Employers & Payers market. They wanted to move away from depending on highly regulated solutions & environments where physicians are required to manage patient care, to a model where family member scan manage the care of their “Loved Ones”.

The company hired Clarice Technologies to help bring their concept to life in form of a clickable prototype. This involved creating user interfaces, user interactions & visual design for their mobile applications.

The goal was to create a multi-platform application that will enable patients to upload, track & maintain their biometric data using iPhone, iPad and PC.

### Solution:
We started with understanding the users & product through a series of interviews with business stakeholders & users. This helped us identify product & user goals. 

User profiles, personas & scenarios were created tounderstand key user goals. 
Scenarios were used to define the user requirements thatserved as foundation to the application.

Detailed task flows were created to understand how users would navigate through the app.

Based on the task flows, detailed information architecture,navigation schema, schematic layouts & visual treatments for theapplication were derived. User feedback was taken into consideration during every phase of this process.
