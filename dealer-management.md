> The portal helped dealers & agents publish advertisements & track leads across various online platforms as well as maintain inventory of their products.

### Solution:
We started with understanding the business goals and its requirements. An ecosystem diagram was created to help understand the relation between various entities in the system. This ensured that our understanding was inline with the overall business process.

We identified the target audience and use case scenarios and created appropriate high level task flows. This was followed by a high level information architecture. A detailed wireframe was created for each of the use cases scenarios.

**The design solutions included:**

- Understanding the business requirements along with identifying & understanding the users.
- Understanding the business as well as user goals.
- Creating a process flow along with a high level storyboard to bridge our understanding.
- Creating task flow & IA based on various use cases.
- Creating wireframes along with detailed interactions for each use case scenarios.
- Designing the visual language that is consistent with the company branding.
