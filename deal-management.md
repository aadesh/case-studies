> The portal offers private equity & M&A firms an opportunity to build new client & deal pipeline by providing users the ability to create new deals as well as shortlist deals from its extensive deals database.

### Solution:
We started with understanding the deal management ecosystem. This helped understand the domain along with understanding the business requirements. A high level IA was created based on the understanding of the overall ecosystem. We kept refining the IA to arrive at a detailed wireframe.

A fresh visual design approach was taken so as to make sure the application looks more trendy.

**Design solution included:**

- Understanding the ecosystem & business requirements.
- Creating a process flow along with a high level storyboard to bridge our understanding.
- Creating high level information architecture.
- Creating wireframes along with detailed interactions for each use case scenarios.
- Designing the visual language that is consistent with the company branding.
